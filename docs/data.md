## Populations genetics

Specifics may vary between samples, however, all species for all three groups are the product of pooled sequence data, 10-20 individuals per sample, with collembolans generally containing the highest number of individuals.

### Collembola

### Beetles

- Pooled sequence data

### Spiders
